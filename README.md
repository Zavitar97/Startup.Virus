# Cstorm
An opensource Prank Startup Scareware for windows developed using C Programming Language.

This Scareware was developed to work with Windows 7 and above versions of Windows only.
This software is not a virus or Malware ( but can be modified to make it more dangerous.) It simply scares the users on whom it is tested. It really does no harm on its own.
